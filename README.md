# Fairy Fireworks

A recreation of Fairy Fireworks from Disney's Pixie Hollow, using the Construct 2 engine.

Current Version: Version 2.0

New in this version:
- [ALL] Click the dots to add them to your basket instead of dragging them to the patterns
- [ALL] Added better dot sprites
- [ALL] Made moths spawn in 15 second intervals instead of 25
- [ALL] Added the white dot of light that instantly fills any pattern
- [BUGFIX] Fixed the hitboxes on the patterns and menus. Should make them easier to work with!
- Added a new Classic Gamemode
  - Includes three lives like in the original game. Get hit by a moth while having light in your basket and you'll lose a life!
